    <p> Water Sampling: All the electronics and code work for the water sampling device! We are done with the electronics! However, we may still need to implement 
        another relay for the purge pump.
        EARTI: Today I did a lot of research on rechargeable batteries and implementing them using UPS caps on the Pi Zero. I originally thought
        our charging system was going to be the Qi wireless charger (induction charging, like for phones), but they charge extremely slowly 
        and are very finicky. I'm considering having a wire connection and having the wires touch when the gantry is in its home position.

    <p>I learned a lot today! Today we got the pressure sensor to output pressure and temperature data. 
        We also got the fan to work with the PocketBeagle. I also implemented a voltage divider to split 
        the 12V input voltage to an additional 7V output.
